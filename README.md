This is the code for my "Inspire" App, which allows the user to push a button and be shown a random Amish saying. Unfortunately I do not know how to export my apps, so it isn't possible to download and use this yet unless you know how to clone repositories and open them in Android Studio/Eclipse. Sorry about that! BUt I hope we still get the points, because the code is real.
